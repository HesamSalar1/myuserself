# Telegram Multi-Bot Management System

## Overview

This project is a multi-bot Telegram management system designed to run multiple Telegram bots simultaneously. The system manages up to 9 individual bots with shared functionality for automated responses, friend/enemy management, and message broadcasting. It includes a unified launcher for orchestration and individual bot configurations for tailored operations.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

- **Session Management**: Pyrogram session handling for persistent bot connections.
- **Bot Features**:
    - Auto-Reply System: Automatic responses to friends and enemies.
    - Unlimited Enemy Spam: Continuous offensive messaging to enemies until stopped by forbidden emojis.
    - User Management: Friend/enemy classification with different response patterns.
    - Smart Pause System: Global and per-chat pause functionality triggered by forbidden emojis or enemy-specific commands.
    - Message Broadcasting: Send messages to all groups simultaneously.
    - Scheduled Messages: Time-based message delivery.
    - Media Support: Handle text, photos, videos, GIFs, stickers, and audio.
    - Statistics Tracking: Monitor bot usage and interactions.
    - Ultra-Advanced Forbidden Content System: Completely redesigned zero-default system with 100% Telegram-based configuration.
    - Supreme Unicode Processing: Bulletproof emoji detection with comprehensive Unicode normalization (NFC, NFD, NFKC, NFKD) and variation selector handling.
    - Intelligent Content Matching: Advanced regex patterns, per-word case sensitivity, partial/exact matching, and word boundary detection.
    - Multi-Layer Security Engine: Simultaneous emoji + word detection with severity levels (1-3) and comprehensive audit trails.
    - Performance-Optimized Detection: Ultra-fast detection with intelligent caching, batch processing, and sub-millisecond response times.
    - Emergency Isolation System: Per-chat security isolation with automatic recovery and cross-bot synchronization.
    - Real-time Security Monitoring: Live statistics, comprehensive audit logs, and detailed security analytics.
    - Enhanced Database Architecture: Advanced schema with trigger counting, last detection tracking, and metadata management.
    - Enemy Command Restrictions: Special commands that only affect enemies (/catch, /grab, /guess, /arise, /take, /secure).
    - Natural Auto-Conversation System: Each bot has a unique personality with diverse, context-aware messages in mixed languages (Persian/English/Hindi).
    - Per-Chat Isolation System: Emergency stop, rate limiting, and spam management operate independently per chat.
    - Global Rate Limiting: Shared locks across all bots per chat to prevent message flooding.
    - Configurable Spam Delay System: Customizable delay settings for enemy attack frequency.
    - Advanced Admin Permission System: Hierarchical admin control with a main launcher admin and individual bot admins.

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React with Vite build system
- **UI Components**: Radix UI component library
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with class-variance-authority
- **State Management**: TanStack React Query for data fetching
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Web Panel Management Interface**: For monitoring bot integration.

### Deployment Architecture
- **Development Environment**: Local development with SQLite, `npm run dev` for frontend.
- **Production Environment**: Autoscale configuration, `npm run build` and `npm run start`.
- **VPS Deployment System**:
    - **Docker Configuration**: Dockerfile and `docker-compose.yml` for containerization.
    - **StackHost Integration**: `stackhost.yaml` for cloud deployment.
    - **System Management**: VPS manager, monitoring system, configuration management.
    - **Service Management**: SystemD service files for all components.
    - **Nginx Configuration**: Load balancer and reverse proxy.
    - **Database Setup**: PostgreSQL with schema and initialization.
